title: "How do Filters work?"
---

Filters in Atlassify help you manage which notifications are shown in the app, allowing you to concentrate on the most crucial ones for your workflow.

<br />

Filters can be accessed from the Atlassify sidebar. By default, all notifications are shown.

<br />

If you apply filters, your inbox will display notifications based on a `LOGICAL AND` condition.
