title: "How do I authenticate Atlassify with my Atlassian account?"
---
Atlassify supports two authentication methods:

## 1. OAuth 2.0 (SSO) - Recommended ✅

The easiest and most secure way to authenticate. Simply sign in with your Atlassian account via your browser.

**[Learn how to set up OAuth authentication →](./6.md)**

## 2. API Token

Atlassify also supports authentication via Atlassian API Tokens:
- ✅ API token with scopes **[strongly recommended]**
- ⚠️ API token _[supported, but not recommended]_

<br />

When authenticating with **API token with scopes** please choose the following Jira product scopes <code>read:account; read:jira-work</code> until more suitably named alternatives are available.

<br />

Please refer to the [official docs](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/#Create-an-API-token-with-scopes) for help creating and managing an **API token with scopes**.
