title: "How do I use OAuth (SSO) to authenticate with Atlassian?"
---
Atlassify now supports **OAuth 2.0 (Single Sign-On)** authentication as an alternative to API tokens!

## Benefits of OAuth Authentication

- ✅ **More Secure**: No need to manage long-lived API tokens
- ✅ **Better UX**: Sign in with your Atlassian account via browser
- ✅ **Auto-refresh**: Tokens are automatically refreshed when they expire
- ✅ **Granular Permissions**: OAuth scopes provide fine-grained access control

## Prerequisites

To use OAuth authentication, you need to create an OAuth 2.0 (3LO) app in the Atlassian Developer Console:

1. Go to [Atlassian Developer Console](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/)
2. Click **Create** → **OAuth 2.0 integration**
3. Fill in your app details:
   - **App name**: Atlassify (or your preferred name)
   - **App description**: Desktop notifications for Atlassian products
4. Under **Permissions**, add the following scopes:
   - `read:me` - User profile information
   - `read:account` - Account details  
   - `offline_access` - Refresh tokens for seamless re-authentication
5. Under **Authorization**, set the **Callback URL** to: `http://localhost:3000/callback`
6. Click **Save**
7. Copy your **Client ID** - you'll need this when logging in

## Using OAuth in Atlassify

1. Open Atlassify and click **Add Account**
2. In the login screen, select the **OAuth (SSO)** tab
3. Click **Sign in with Atlassian**
4. Your browser will open to the Atlassian authentication page
5. Sign in with your Atlassian credentials
6. Grant the requested permissions
7. You'll be redirected back to Atlassify automatically
8. You're now authenticated! 🎉

## Troubleshooting

### "OAuth Client ID not configured" error

This means you need to set up an OAuth app in the Atlassian Developer Console (see Prerequisites above). Currently, each user needs to create their own OAuth app due to Atlassian's OAuth requirements.

### Authentication window doesn't redirect back

Make sure you configured the callback URL as `http://localhost:3000/callback` in your OAuth app settings.

### Still having issues?

You can always fall back to **API Token** authentication using the first tab in the login screen.

## Security Note

OAuth tokens are encrypted and stored securely using your system's credential storage (Keychain on macOS, Credential Manager on Windows, libsecret on Linux).
